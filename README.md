# Take-Note
A Project intended to aid in helping you become a professional musician.

We utilize a number of ML models to assist with the music produciton process by automatically generating harmonies for a user supplied melody.

To run our code please refer to the README within the coconet_torch folder or the transformer folder.

The Harmony generation provided by the baseline models are very poor and hence use of these models for music generation is discouraged.
